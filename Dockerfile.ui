# --server.port 8501: specifies the port
# --server.headless true: allows Streamlit to run without a browser window popping up
# --server.enableCORS false: recommended for security if not explicitly needed
# --server.enableXsrfProtection false: potentially needed in Docker environments if you run into issues, but try without first
# The critical change here is that we are NOT starting uvicorn.
# The Streamlit app will be configured to talk to the API service directly via http://api:8000.
